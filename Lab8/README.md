# Lab 8

In this lab, we will start creating 3D objects. First, we create a cube, so that we can create more complex objects in the future.

After creating more complex objects, we will overflight the scene. This way, the object can be looked at from different points.

Next, we will learn instanced rendering and how to work with 3D curves.
