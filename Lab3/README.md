# Lab 3

In this lab, we will learn how to work with the face and the back of a polygon. Also, we will write our first mouse handler function.

## Creating the project

**Note**: Don't forget to link `freeglut.lib` and `glew32.lib` to the project, as described in the first lab.

For the first 2 source codes, we will not be using shaders, but for the third one we will be using the vertex and fragment shaders, so don't forget to copy and load `loadShaders.cpp` and `loadShaders.h`.
