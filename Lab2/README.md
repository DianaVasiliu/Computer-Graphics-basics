# Lab 2

In this lab, we will learn how to create and render new primitives and working with external shaders.

Also, we will learn to different between old and new OpenGL, and how to transfer code from old to new OpenGL.

## Creating the project

**Note**: Don't forget to link `freeglut.lib` and `glew32.lib` to the project, as described in the first lab.

In this lab, we will start working with external shaders. You are given the shader files. Add them into the project folder and into the Solution Explorer in the `Resource Files` folder.

Also, you are provided 2 new files, `loadShaders.h` and `loadShaders.cpp`, used to load the external shaders. Make sure you copy them into the project folder and add them into the Solution Explorer in Visual Studio.
