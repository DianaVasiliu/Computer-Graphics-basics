# Lab 6

In this lab, we will continue working with vertex indices and then we will start working with textures.

For this lab, you will need to install the [SOIL](../SOIL) library.

In this folder, you will find a `.h` and a `.lib` file. Move the `.lib` file in the installation directory of Microsoft Visual Studio, in the `lib` folder. You will also need to link the library to the project. Create a new folder `SOIL` into your project (where your source codes are) and copy the `.h` file into this folder.

**Note**: When linking the `SOIL.lib` library, you might need to specify the full path to the file.
