# Lab 4

In this lab, we will learn how to use transformations with `glm`.

First, we create a simple animation, then we make 2D scenes that can be controlled with the mouse or keyboard.

Another important thing to learn in this lab is transformation compositions and understanding how to multiply matrices in the shader or in the main program.

In the end, you will be creating a 2D scene from scratch, according to some requirements.
