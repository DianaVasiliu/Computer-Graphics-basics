# Lab 5

In this lab, we will be working with the fourth coordinate of a vertex. The goal is to understand it's role.

We will also start using different drawing functions and learn how to use vertex indices.

# Project

Develop a 2D project by choosing a theme from the list below.

-   **2D DOMINO**: Make a 2D domino made up of rectangles having the same size. The first begins to move (rotation around a point - indicated in the figure) and engages the others.
-   **OVERCOMING**: Simulate an "overtaking": a rectangle moves evenly (by translation), another rectangle comes from behind (also by translations), at some point enters overtaking, then passes in front of the first.
-   **BILLIARD GAME**: Create a 2D billiard (with rules you define); the collisions to be represented as realistically as possible.
-   **FLOCK OF BIRDS**: Create a "flock of birds" (2D); during the movement, the birds change their places between them.
-   **FREE CHOSEN THEME**: Create a 2D scene in which to use transformations, composing transformations, managing modeling matrices.
